 <h2> How Black History Month started</h2>

  <p>In 1915, in response to the lack of information on the accomplishments of Black people available to the public, historian Carter G. Woodson co-founded the Association for the Study of Black Life and History. In 1926, the group declared the second week of February as “Black History Week” to recognize the contributions of African Americans to U.S. history. Few people studied Black history and it wasn't included in textbooks prior to the creation of Black History Week.<br>
<br>
This week was chosen because it includes the birthdays of both Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist (someone who wanted to end the practice of enslaving people), and former U.S. president Abraham Lincoln. President Lincoln led the United States during the Civil War, which was primarily fought over the enslavement of Black people in the country. Many schools and leaders began recognizing the week after its creation.<br>
<br>
The week-long event officially became Black History Month in 1976 when U.S. president Gerald Ford extended the recognition to “honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.” Black History Month has been celebrated in the United States every February since.</p>

  <h2> What it honors</h2>
  
  <p>Black History Month was created to focus attention on the contributions of African Americans to the United States. It honors all Black people from all periods of U.S. history, from the enslaved people first brought over from Africa in the early 17th century to African Americans living in the United States today. <br>
<br>
Among the notable figures often spotlighted during Black History Month are Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who fought for equal rights for Blacks during the 1950s and ’60s; Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American justice appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1967; Mae Jemison, who became the first female African-American astronaut to travel to space in 1992; and Barack Obama, who was elected the first-ever African-American president of the United States in 2008.

  <h2> Black History Month today</h2>
  <p>
  Since the first Black History Week in 1926, other countries have joined the United States in celebrating Black people and their contribution to history and culture, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. <br>
<br>
Today Black History Month continues the discussion of Black people and their contributions through activities such as museum exhibits and film screenings, and by encouraging the study of achievements by African Americans year-round.

  <h2> Jerry Lawson</h2>

  <p> Jerry Lawson is best known for his time at legendary Silicon Valley semiconductor firm Fairchild. While there, he proved instrumental in the development of the world's first cartridge-based (read: computerized) video game system(Opens in a new window), the Fairchild Channel F (1976). Lawson did electronics design for the console, went on to found his own video game company, VideoSoft, and was then a mentor at Stanford. He passed away in 2011. I interviewed Lawson in 2009(Opens in a new window), and it was an illuminating discussion. Jerry's story was also recently highlighted in an audiobook as well as a Google Doodle(Opens in a new window).

  <h2>Ed Smith</h2>
 <center> <div id = "img_border"> <img src = "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/lineupitems/04igo1eF3YHAnZgjGQFg4vU.fit_lim.size_1600x880.v1569508561.jpg" width = 500> </div> </center>
  <p>Ed Smith got his start in Brooklyn working on traffic control signal for Marbelite. From there he went on to co-design an early cartridge-based video game system, the APF MP-1000 (1978) for New York-based APF Electronics. He also worked on its computer attachment, the Imagination Machine, which competed with products from Apple and Atari in the late 1970s. After his time at APF, he became a successful electronics salesman, a career he continues to this day. For more on Smith's fascinating career, you can read an interview I did with him(Opens in a new window) several years ago.</p>
 
  <h2> Mark Hannah</h2>

  <p>In 1982, Dr. Marc Hannah and several other computer scientists founded Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), a highly influential computer graphics firm that specialized in software and hardware for creating cutting-edge 3D illustrations and effects, especially for films such as <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Terminator 2</em>. The advancement of lower-cost graphics solutions led to the end of SGI in 2009, although Hannah left the firm in 1997. Hannah has since been involved in several high-tech businesses (including SongPro, a firm that created an MP3 player for the Game Boy Advance in 2002) and is still highly respected in the industry.

  <h2>Mark Dean</h2>

  <p>Tennessee native Dr. Mark Dean joined IBM in 1980, and soon after became part of the team that developed the revolutionary IBM PC 5150, released in 1981. As part of that process, he co-created the PC's ISA bus, and he is named on three of the nine original patents that define foundational IBM PC technology. For his numerous achievements at IBM, the firm named Dean an IBM Fellow in 1995, one of only 50 active at the firm and the first African-American so honored. In 1999, Dean led a group at IBM to create a 1GHz CPU, and today he is a professor(Opens in a new window) at the University of Tennessee.</p>

  <h2>Clarence 'Skip' Ellis</h2>
  <center><div id = "img_border"> <img src = "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/lineupitems/05jGSdHergSeycJFAG3FcPh.fit_lim.size_1600x880.v1569507292.jpg" width = 500>  </center> </div>
  <p>Dr. Clarence Ellis, better known as Skip, was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in computer science (in 1969 at the University of Illinois). He became interested in computers as a teenager when he was tasked with guarding a commercial computer system; having studied the manuals in his spare time, he surprised his employers by solving many technical problems. At Xerox PARC in the 1970s and 80s, he pioneered Officetalk, a collaborative office work system that presaged today's frequently used apps, like Google Docs. As a sought-after computer researcher, he worked at firms like Bell Labs, IBM, Los Alamos Scientific Lab, and many more during his long career. He passed away in 2014. </p>
